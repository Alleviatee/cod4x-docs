# CoD4x

CoD4x is a community driven project that extends the basic functionality of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Initially development has started only on the server-side with the by now deprecated version 1.7a. The current version of CoD4x is 1.8 and contains modifications to the base server aswell as the client. 

## Motivation

It is great that ATVI has provided such an extensive modding framework with Call of Duty 4, but a\) the official masterserver went down multiple times, and has not been fixed for several months in the past b\) punkbuster support has been discontinued, which made cheating a huge problem. c\) modders felt limited with the provided functionality.
