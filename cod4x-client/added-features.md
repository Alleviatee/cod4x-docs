# Added Features

A range of **functional features** has been added to the CoD4x client. Some of which are described and explained in the following sections.

## Add Favorites to Serverbrowser

In the original game it was a big hassle to manage server favorites as it required manually typing the IP addresses and ports for servers. Especially, when the favorite list bugs out again and deletes itself \*sigh\*.

CoD4x adds the client command `addFavorite` to make management of your favorite servers more convenient. The command can be used in two ways.

* **You are currently playing on a server**  
  Just type `\addFavorite` into your console and the server you are playing on will be added to your favorites

* **In every other case ...**  
  ... you can just add the ip and port as an argument to the command, to add any server to your favorites.  
  E.g.: `\addFavorite 127.0.0.1:28960`

## Steam Groups

CoD4x makes playing with your clan tag more convenient. Make sure your steam client is running already, and start the game. Open up the console and start typing `\clan`. \(**Make sure you hit the spacebar after typing **`clan`\). The auto-completion will show to you your available steam groups. By typing `\clan <number>` you can select any of them. Typing `\clan 0` removes any currently shown steam group from your name.
