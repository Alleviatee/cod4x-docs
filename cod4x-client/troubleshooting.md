# Client Troubleshooting

Common problems and how to solve them

#### I change my mp\_config.cfg, but the settings are not changed ingame

[read the fucking manual](/cod4x-client/config-files.md) :\) The location of config files has been changed for 1.8x compared to 1.7.

#### The game is crashing

Post to our forum with as much detail as possible about the problem

* When exactly does the crash happen \(Starting the game, joining a server, what's written on the screen\)
* Try resetting your [config and profile](/cod4x-client/config-files.md) \(Make a backup first to not miss them later!\)
* Append the files of the crash reporter to your forum post \(Click on "What does this report contain" once the crash reporting dialog has opened\)
* Pray to the CoD gods
