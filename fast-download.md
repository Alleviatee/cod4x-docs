# Fast Download

While players are able to download mods and custom maps of a server without any special configuration, this is only possible with a very limited download speed. Much more effective is the configuration of a fast download http server. 

The following settings in your server configuration are necessary:

`seta sv_wwwDownload "1"                            // enable download redirection`

`seta sv_wwwBaseURL "http://domain.tld/cod4fastdl/" // defines url to download from`

`seta sv_wwwDlDisconnected "0"                      // disconnect clients while downloading`
