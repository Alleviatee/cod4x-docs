### Script Locations

In the introductory example we have already learned that scripts can be loaded from the `main_shared` folder. However, there is several more locations that scripts can be loaded from.

* localized\_zone07.iwd \( among others, but that one is relevant \)
* main\_shared
* raw
* raw\_shared

if `fs_devdir` is set to `1` also \( note that the devdirs are preferred over the other locations \) :

* dev\_raw
* devraw\_shared
