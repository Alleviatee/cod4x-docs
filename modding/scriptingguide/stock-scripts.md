## Stock Scripts &gt;&gt; wip &lt;&lt;

The purpose of this guide is mainly to teach how to write new script files, but obviously each mod and even the stock game already contain tons of scripts. The stock scripts are available [here](https://github.com/D4edalus/CoD4MW/tree/master/raw). The gsc scripts of the stock games and other mods are a great resource to explore the capabilities of gsc scripting.
