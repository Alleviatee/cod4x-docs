# Using Plugins

A range of plugins is available from our github, and is maintained by the CoD4x team. To use plugins you first have to create a folder called `plugins` inside your server directory. Then drop the respective plugin you want to use in that folder. Plugins maintained by us are published with [Github Releases](https://github.com/callofduty4x/CoD4x_Server/releases) automatically.

Once the file is in place the plugin can be loaded with the `loadplugin` command. It can be executed from the commandline, config files, or gsc script files. Hint: omit the file extension when loading the plugin.

> Example: loadplugin simplebanlist
